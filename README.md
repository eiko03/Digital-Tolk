## THOUGHTS
- Booking Repository is overloaded with huge chunk of codes. Some kind of prebuilt hashmap or serializer should do the job of all this if else condition.
- SOLID was no followed properly. If I did this, I would stop with those repeated line. I would create a bunch on helper private methods to achieve this.
- For API response I would create a custom interface or abstract class for uniformity. 
- Validation with separate requests file is much preferred.
